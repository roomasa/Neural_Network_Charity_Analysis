# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis


### Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

### The purpose of this analysis: 
To identify those foundations who are likely to be successful in that the money given to them was used effectivel

### Results:
1. 'is Successful' is the target variable
2. NAME and EIN are neither target nor features and should be removed
3. The remaining 43 variables are potential features
4. there are two layers in the model with 80 nodes in the first layers and 30 in the second layer, this is to keep the nodes at roughly 2-3 times the number of features
5. the model is not  accurate at predicting and needs optomization
